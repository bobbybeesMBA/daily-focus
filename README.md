# Task Dawn

**Ignite your day with prioritized tasks in your inbox.**

Task Dawn aggregates tasks from Google Tasks and iCloud Reminders, ranks them by urgency, age, and your settings, then emails a top 3 summary every weekday morning - no new apps, just enhanced routine.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Pulls from all Google Task lists, including iCloud Reminders synced via IFTTT
- **Auto-Initialization**: Creates "Task Dawn Sync" list automatically on first run for iCloud integration
- **Smart Ranking**: Prioritizes tasks by:
  1. `URGENT` keyword in title (case-insensitive)
  2. Overdue due dates
  3. FIFO (oldest created first)
- **Daily Digest**: Top 3 tasks delivered to your inbox every weekday
- **Zero App Switching**: Works entirely through email and existing task apps
- **SaaS-Ready Template**: Zero-knowledge architecture with plug-and-play GitHub Actions deployment

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Setup Wizard

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard will guide you through:
- Setting up the iCloud-to-Google bridge (IFTTT)
- Creating Google Cloud credentials
- Authenticating to get your Refresh Token
- **Automatically saves your `.env` file**
- Generating GitHub Secrets for automation

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Actions

Push to GitHub and add the secrets from the setup wizard:

```
Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
```

Required secrets:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- `EMAIL_USER`
- `EMAIL_PASS`

The workflow runs automatically at 12:00 UTC on weekdays.

## iCloud Integration

Task Dawn reads from Google Tasks. To include iCloud Reminders:

1. Create a free [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) account
2. Create an Applet:
   - **If This**: iOS Reminders > New reminder added to list
   - **Then That**: Google Tasks > Create task in task list > **"Task Dawn Sync"**
3. The "Task Dawn Sync" list is created automatically on first run
4. Repeat the IFTTT setup for each iCloud list you want to sync

## SaaS Template Deployment

Task Dawn is designed as a **standardized template** for white-label deployment:

### manifest.json
Contains all required environment variables for automated provisioning:
- Lists all 5 required secrets (Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token, Email User, Email Pass)
- Validation patterns for each secret type
- OAuth scopes and setup wizard configuration
- See `manifest.json` for the complete deployment specification

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- All credentials read exclusively from `process.env`
- No hardcoded personal information anywhere in the codebase
- Clean slate ready for copy-paste deployment to any user's GitHub account

### Plug-and-Play GitHub Actions
The workflow in `.github/workflows/daily_focus.yml`:
- Uses pre-built `dist/` files (no npm install or build needed)
- Runs automatically on weekdays at 12:00 UTC
- Just needs the 5 GitHub secrets configured

## Ranking Algorithm

Tasks are sorted in this priority order:

| Priority | Criteria | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Title contains "URGENT" | "URGENT: Call client" |
| 2 | Due date is in the past | Due: Dec 20 (today is Dec 25) |
| 3 | Oldest created first | Created 5 days ago beats yesterday |
